	<p> This paper is an overview of 3D scanning is the process of analyzing a real-world object or environment to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance (e.g. colour). The collected data can then be used to construct digital 3D models.In this process of obtaining the 3D shapes of the component whose physical attributes are difficult to measure, the scanning obtains the data in the form of point cloud data or triangular mesh, these point cloud form of data is used to create the 3D model of the component by using some CAD software. A 3D scanner can be based on many different technologies, each with its own limitations, advantages and costs, one of which iscamera calibration.This method uses the checkerboard pattern for calibrating 2D points of the camera plane with 3D points of the real world[1]. As the scanning involves sensors, cameras whose output may vary depending upon external conditions. The quality of 3D scanned data is influenced by many factors, such as scanned surface colour, glossiness, geometry, ambient light, scanner resolution, proper selection of scanned segments, etc. Ambient light is important source of errors, especially for scanners that are based on projected patterns and structured lighting [2]. The main disadvantage of using commercial scanners is the cost involved with it.The cost of scanner can be reduced by reducing the cost of scanning tools involved in it. Hence, this project is an attempt to create a standard CAD file with 3D Scanner using IR distance sensor with an objective to design and develop a costeffective 3D scanner.</p><br/>
